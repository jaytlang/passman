  passman
===========

Simple password manager. Plug in a microSD card that's running an
encrypted LUKS volume, decrypt it when you need, and then run this
program to access, generate, and store randomly generated passwords
on demand.

Just don't lose the SD card (: Type 'make' and then do ./passman
to get started.
